# LED-Blinking-rate
### Let's change the blinking rate of two leds using push buttons.
#### The components needed are:
1. 1 LED
2. 2 Push buttons
3. 2 Capacitors (0.1uf)
4. Some resitors (10K ohm)
5. Arduino
6. Jumper wires or wires.
#### The connections are:
The +ve of led is connected to PINB5 and -ve to ground.
One pin of the push buttons are connected to PIND2, PIND3 and the other to ground. The RC circuit is connected parallel to the push button to avoid bouncing effect.
